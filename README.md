# Classification
It is a beginner’s approach to classification. Scikit-learn’s SVM was used to create a vector classifier. It also includes Implements an artificial neural network (ANN) approach using Keras. A simple introduction to multi-layer perceptron in Keras.

The dataset used here is MNIST dataset. MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the “hello world” dataset of computer vision. This dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. For new machine learning techniques, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners.

1- You can get the dataset via kaggle from the following link 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data

2- Install Scikit-learn, Tensorflow and Keras. It is prefered to use Anaconda.
It is a freemium open source distribution of the Python

3- Run the SVM_trainer.py script.

4- Open this script and try to understand each part of the code.

This code is to get familiar with this popular learning libraries.
